# jira-sandbox

Playground sandbox for Atlassian applications with automated server setup with [vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com). 
If you have all prerequisite tools installed you should get sandbox running in 3 steps:

    ~$ git clone https://github.com/wooyek/jira-sandbox.git
    ~$ cd jira-sandbox/
    ~/jira-sandbox$ vagrant up full

## Prerequisites

Before you can enjoy quick virtual machine provisioning you need to manually install 
[VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/) and [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/) 

- https://www.virtualbox.org/
- https://www.vagrantup.com/
- https://git-scm.com/downloads

Please download Atlassian software installation files
and put them in [downloads](downloads) folder:

1. [atlassian-jira-software-7.0.0-jira-7.0.0-x64.bin](https://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/downloads/binary/atlassian-jira-software-7.0.0-jira-7.0.0-x64.bin)
1. [atlassian-confluence-5.8.14-x64.bin](https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence/downloads/binary/atlassian-confluence-5.8.14-x64.bin)
2. [atlassian-bitbucket-4.0.2-x64.bin](https://www.atlassian.com/software/stash/downloads/binary/atlassian-bitbucket-4.0.2-x64.bin)
4. [atlassian-bamboo-5.9.4.tar.gz](https://www.atlassian.com/software/bamboo/downloads/binary/atlassian-bamboo-5.9.4.tar.gz)

You can download them with [download-x64.sh](download-x64.sh) script.

## Sub domain mapping on host system

To use this sandbox you'll need to map few domains to localhost. You'll need admin privileges to do this.

On Windows host edit `%SystemRoot%\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` file:

On Linux host edit `/etc/hosts` file:

â€¦and place following mapping there:

    127.0.0.1  localhost dev.example.com jira.example.com bamboo.example.com confluence.example.com bitbucket.example.com

## Virtual machine provisioning

To finish setting up this sandbox run:

    jira-sandbox$ vagrant up full
    
or
    
    jira-sandbox$ vagrant up testing
    
See [vagrnat up](https://docs.vagrantup.com/v2/getting-started/index.html) command description for more details. 

## Post setup configuration
 
After your sandbox virtual machine is up and running, you should be able to access it through following URLs.
Each time select testing configuration with built in database for quick configuration.
 
1. http://jira.example.com/  
    <a href="http://jira.example.com/"><img src="doc/jira-setup.jpg"></a>
    
2. http://confluence.example.com/  
    <a href="http://jira.example.com/"><img src="doc/confluence-setup.jpg"></a>
    
3. http://bitbucket.example.com/  
    <a href="http://jira.example.com/"><img src="doc/bitbucket-setup.jpg"></a>

4. http://bamboo.example.com/  
    <a href="http://jira.example.com/"><img src="doc/bamboo-setup.jpg"></a>

## Run on different port than 80

I you have port 80 already taken, you can change port mapping in [Vagrantfile](Vagrantfile) 
and listening port for Nginx in [atlassian.conf](atlassian.conf), then:

    ~$ vagrant reload
    ~$ vagrant ssh full
    vagrant@jira-sandbox:~$ sudo cp /vagrant/atlassian.conf ./
    vagrant@jira-sandbox:~$ sudo nginx -s reload
    
## One domain with context paths

There is an experimental support for one domain and setup of all services in context paths like http://localhost/jira.

To run services on one domain you'll need to modify Tomcat configuration files on installes services. See the [attlasian-one-domain.sh](attlasian-one-domain.sh) for examples.

Nginx configuration for this setup is in [atlassian-one-domain.conf](atlassian-one-domain.conf).

Please bare in mind that you'll problaby run into issues with Bitbucket 
as [cookies can be overwritten by different services](https://confluence.atlassian.com/display/BitbucketServerKB/XSRF+Security+Token+Missing).
