â€¦and place this mapping there:

> 127.0.0.1  localhost dev.example.com jira.example.com bamboo.example.com confluence.example.com bitbucket.example.com

## Run on one domain context paths

To run services on one domain you'll need to modify tomcat configuration files on installes services. See the [attlasian-in-context.sh](attlasian-in-context.sh) for examples.

Nginx configuration for this setup is in [atlassian.conf](atlassian.conf).
